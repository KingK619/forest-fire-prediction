## Forest-Fire-Prediction
The goal is to predict if there will be a forest fire ML/DL techniques.

### Climate Change

Wildfires emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that will continue to warm the planet well into the future. They damage forests that would otherwise remove CO2 from the air. And they inject soot and other aerosols into the atmosphere, with complex effects on warming and cooling.

### Description of the Application:
[Forest Fire Prediction App](https://forest-valley-fire-prediction.herokuapp.com/) is a Machine Learning Based App,currently on a MLP Classifier Model,with a accuracy of 53%.The web application is built on Streamlit which is a python liberary. We have analyzed a dataset collected from the major forests in the world, mainly focusing on USA,Brazil and Austraila. Firstly, we established relationships between the meteorological factors(e.g. temperatrue, relative humidity, wind) as well as model features(e.g. FFMC, DMC) correlated to forest fires. Having acquired the weights and influence of different factors on forest fires, We then applied the relationship to building a prediction system for forest fires. The system will calculate the parametrs input and give feedback on the probability of potential forest fires which is then displayed using maps.

Dataset link:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/ rates fire hazards based on both natural factors, such as humidity, as well as artificial factors, such as litter. All data is collected from Montesinho park, located in Portugal, with more than 570 instances through 2001 to 2003. 

### Scope of Improvement:
Currently working on imporving the model,to increase the accuracy of model.
