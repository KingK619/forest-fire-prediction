## Forest-Fire-Prediction
The goal is to predict if there will be a forest fire ML/DL techniques.

#### Description of the Application:
[Forest Fire Prediction App](https://forest-valley-fire-prediction.herokuapp.com/) is a Machine Learning Based App,currently on a MLP Classifier Model,with a accuracy of 53%.The Frontend has been built using Html,CSS,Bootstrap,MaterialUI and backend is running on a Flask Server. We have analyzed a dataset collected from forests in the northeast region of Portugal with the utilization of FWI system. Firstly, we established relationships between the meteorological factors(e.g. temperatrue, relative humidity, wind) as well as model features(e.g. FFMC, DMC) correlated to forest fires. Having acquired the weights and influence of different factors on forest fires, We then applied the relationship to building a prediction system for forest fires. The system will calculate the parametrs input and give feedback on the probability of potential forest fires using SVM.

Dataset link:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/ rates fire hazards based on both natural factors, such as humidity, as well as artificial factors, such as litter. All data is collected from Montesinho park, located in Portugal, with more than 570 instances through 2001 to 2003. 

#### Scope of Improvement:
Currently working on imporving the model,to increase the accuracy of model.
